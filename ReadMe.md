These are my answers for Project Euler problems

Project Euler is a series of programming challenges. 
It's fun and you should try it at http://projecteuler.net

It's only in Ruby for now, but I may add other languages in the future for learning.

They are the ones I've written before reading PDF overviews you get when succeeding, so I guess they can be far more optimized.
